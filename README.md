# MIPS-Hashing-MIPS Assembly Hashing Algorithm
Project Overview
This project implements an 8-bit hashing algorithm using MIPS assembly language. The algorithm leverages polynomial transformations and XOR operations to generate hash values efficiently. It is designed to operate within the MARS IDE, ensuring compliance with MIPS conventions and optimal memory usage.

## Features

-Implements an 8-bit hashing algorithm.

-Uses polynomial transformations and XOR operations for hashing.

-Optimized for performance in the MARS IDE.

Requirements
MARS IDE: Required to run the MIPS assembly code.

Basic understanding of MIPS assembly language.

Example
addi $t0, $zero, 0x45      # Input value
xor $t1, $t0, 0x23         # XOR operation
addi $v0, $t1, 0x12        # Polynomial transformation
